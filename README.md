## Why would you keep a watchlist in markdown instead of something like [Anilist](https://anilist.co)?

### Benefits:

- I get to use [Markdown](https://github.com/besterestmark/bettermark) for even more things. Other uses for markdown I have are:
  1. List of all the 4-leaf clovers I've found. (Over 22!)
  2. My TODO list.
  3. Every time a Devil Fruit is mentioned in the *One Piece* manga and general notes about them.
  4. Every time a dial is mentioned in the *One Piece* manga and general notes about them.
  5. Fast and pretty note taking
- Can export to many different formats like CSV, HTML, G*ogle sheets, PDF, LaTeX and many more with tools like [pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
- No need to rely on a third-party app that only works online and with an account
- Can use any text editor I want for it

### Downsides:

- Have to enter episode/chapter count by hand instead of it automatically being done
- Cannot easily calculate how many episodes/chapters I've watched/read
