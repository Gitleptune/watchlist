## Anime Movie quotes

> Every book is connected. For example, that girl has the entire Sherlock Holmes
> collection. Take the author, Conan Doyle. Getting inspiration from the French
> author Jules Verne, he wrote the science fiction novel "The Lost World". Now,
> Verne was inspired by Alexandre Dumas to write Mathias Sandorf. Dumas' work,
> "The Count Of Monte Cristo", came to Japan under the name "The Cavern King".
> The first to adapt it waas Kuroiwa Ruiko of the Yorozu Morning News. And he in
> turn appeared as a character in the novel "The Meiji Tower Of Babel". the
> author of that was Yamada Futaro. in his, "War Generation Anti-War Diaries,"
> Yamada declared the novel "Oni Fire" to be utter rubbish. That was written by
> Yokomizo Seishi. He was an editor at the magazine "Shin Seinen" in his youth,
> and his co-editor at the time was Watanabe On, author of the "The Androgynous
> Scion." Tanizaki Junichiro submitted an article titled "Harusamu" to honor him
> after his death. Tanizaki himself engaged in a fierce literary dispute with
> Akutagawa Ryuunosuke. Months after the dispute, Akutagwaa took his own life.
> Uchida Hyakken explored the particulars of this suicide in "Bowler Hat". This
> work was then praised by Mishima Yukio. At the age of 22, Mishima declared his
> hatred of Dazai Osamu directly to Dazai's face. Dazai wrote an article in
> memory of a friend who died of tuberulosis- the author of that book there, Oda
> Sakunosuke.
> God of Used Books, The Night is Short, Walk on Girl

> Not clever, not talented. Not financially stable, not strong, not determined.
> Not charistmatic, not a lovable little piglet you'd want to rub cheeks with.
> Just an eternal string of "I'm not"s.
> Not clever, not talented.
